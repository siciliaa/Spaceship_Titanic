This repository contains my solutions to the Spaceship Titanic competition on Kaggle.

The goal of the challenge is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during a mysterious interstellar incident, based on various features such as age, spending habits, and cabin location.

**Contents**
* EDA & preprocessing. Data cleaning, feature engineering and exploration.
* Modeling. Training machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) and evaluation performance.

**Techniques Used**
* Scikit-learn.
* Pandas & NumPy.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization.
* Cross-validation
* Feature selection.

**Final Score**

Achieved a public leaderboard score of **0.80360**, ranking 271st out of 1,955 participants (**top 15%**).
